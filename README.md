# Circle-Beat 
A modified rhythm game extension of your usual block breaker game! It's a lot of fun!

### Great! So how do I play this game?
I've uploaded the game over [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1x2yzp-x-h30sathUbh5mq6ocyQXgJl0N)! Feel free to download the folder and run `Block Breaker.exe`, and everything should boot up nice and smoothly!
